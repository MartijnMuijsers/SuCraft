Here you can add your own ideas :) I think it's important to listen to what everyone thinks. Thank you for any suggestions, ideas and bug reports, it helps a lot. 
* Open the **[Issues](https://github.com/MartijnMuijsers/SuCraft/issues)** page to suggest a feature, report a bug, etc.
* Check the **[Project](https://github.com/MartijnMuijsers/SuCraft/projects/1)** page to view the updates

*(Please remember that I try very hard, but managing the server while also adding new things costs me a lot of effort, and usually I have to do many difficult things (network setup, anti-grief, fixing existing bugs) before I can do the most fun things (like new achievements). So of course it may take some time to add an idea* ðŸ˜„ðŸ§ª *)*
